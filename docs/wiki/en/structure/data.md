# `Enms.Data`

This project contains all entities and queries for the database. The entities
are kept in the `Entities` namespace and queries are functions in the
`EnmsDbClient` class. The class is partial and it is divided into conceptually
similar files (ie. all queries for meters are in the EnmsDbClientMeters.cs
file).

## Schema

[The schema](../../../schema.md) is generated using `mermerd` when it is
migrated to the latest migration generated by `dotnet ef`.
